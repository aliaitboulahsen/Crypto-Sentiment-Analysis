# Crypto Sentiment Analysis

## Background

There's been a lot of hype in the news lately about cryptocurrency, so we want to take stock, so to speak, of the latest news headlines regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum to get a better feel for the current public sentiment around each coin.
We will apply natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. We will also apply fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles.

### We will complete the following tasks:

1.) Sentiment Analysis

2.) Natural Language Processing

3.) Named Entity Recognition

We will use NLTK, Spacy, NewsAPI among other tools for our analysis.
